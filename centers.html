                        <br><br>Throughout the duration of the project, our aim is to enhance the capabilities of partner universities
                        by
                        establishing Centers for Psychological Resilience and Wellbeing. These centers will play a pivotal role in
                        providing top-tier psychological support to the university community grappling with the ramifications of war.
                        Moreover, the overarching objective of the project is to heighten awareness surrounding psychological resilience
                        and wellbeing within these academic institutions, while simultaneously bolstering expertise in trauma-informed
                        therapy among students and faculty members.
                        <br><br>We aspire to initiate collaborations with local authorities and volunteers dedicated to aiding those
                        impacted by war. Through this collaboration, we seek to cultivate a new cadre of psychologists equipped with
                        advanced methods and techniques essential for assisting individuals profoundly affected by the scourge of war in
                        attaining equilibrium and happiness.
                        <br><br>Drawing on insights from the webinar series “Center for Psychological Resilience and Wellbeing at EU
                        Universities”, knowledge gained from Centers in Germany, Latvia, and Estonia, and skills acquired during the
                        BURN Winter School (IPU) and TU training course “How to Keep the Professional Level High”, <span>Ukrainian
                            partners
                            developed the Founding Documents (Statutes) for the Centers for Psychological Resilience and
                            Wellbeing.</span>
