                This course delves into the psychological impact of trauma and explores theoretical frameworks for trauma recovery using mindfulness-based art therapy. Course focuses on a comprehensive understanding of the neurobiological, emotional, and cognitive responses to traumatic experiences, including acute, chronic, and complex trauma. The course introduces Mindfulness-Based Art Therapy (MBAT) as an effective therapeutic approach for trauma survivors. Through case studies, discussions, and reflective exercises with art material, students will learn to recognize the effects of trauma on individuals and communities. Students will learn the fundamentals of trauma-informed care and the role of mindfulness in stabilization and grounding. Through art therapy techniques and reflective practices, students will develop the skills to integrate MBAT into therapeutic practice, considering ethical considerations, cultural sensitivity, and trauma-sensitive environments.
