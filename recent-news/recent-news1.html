                <p>The war in Ukraine has intensified the need for comprehensive psychological support for students, educators, and
                    communities. To address this, five Ukrainian universities, in partnership with the European Union’s Erasmus+
                    program, have launched Centers for Psychological Resilience and Wellbeing. These Centers aim to strengthen
                    mental health services, promote emotional resilience, and provide practical training in trauma-informed care.
                    <br>In September 2025, <span>Ternopil Volodymyr Hnatiuk National Pedagogical University (TNPU)</span>
                    inaugurated its Center. Established through extensive preparation and collaboration with European partners, it
                    offers individual and group counseling, trauma support, and supervision for practitioners. The Center also
                    functions as a hub for research and education, providing resilience-building programs, workshops, and
                    internships for psychology students.
                </p>

                <p>On 29 September 2025, <span>Kryvyi Rih State Pedagogical University (KRSPU)</span> opened its Center as an
                    institutional and regional hub. Integrating international standards and modern equipment, it serves students,
                    staff, and local residents, including military personnel. Services include stabilization sessions,
                    psychoeducation, and access to specialized tools such as relaxation chairs and light-therapy devices. The Center
                    also delivers professional development for municipal psychologists and emergency service personnel.</p>

                <p><span>Bogdan Khmelnitsky Melitopol State Pedagogical University (BK MSPU)</span> launched its Center to provide
                    accessible mental health support and resilience training for students, faculty, and staff affected by wartime
                    stress. The Center combines evidence-based psychological methods with community-focused programs to foster
                    emotional wellbeing.</p>
                <img src="/BURN/imgs/recent-news.jpg" alt="">
                <p>At <span>Kherson State University</span>, the Center focuses on creating student-oriented spaces for reflection,
                    learning, and personal growth. It implements trauma-informed interventions, offers psychoeducational sessions,
                    and serves as a practical training site for psychology students, enabling them to engage directly with clients
                    under supervision.

                <p>Collectively, these five Centers combine direct psychological services, professional training, and applied
                    educational practice to build sustainable, competence-based mental health ecosystems. They strengthen
                    psychological resilience, enhance emotional regulation, and provide practical support for the academic community
                    and society in wartime and post-war Ukraine.
