                In September 2025, the Center for Psychological Resilience and Wellbeing commenced its work at Ternopil Volodymyr
                Hnatiuk National Pedagogical University – an important milestone achieved through international cooperation within the
                ERASMUS+ project “Strengthening Psychological Resilience and Wellbeing of Universities in (Post-)War Ukraine” (No.
                101129379 — BURN — ERASMUS-EDU-2023-CBHE).
                <br><br>The opening of the Center was preceded by extensive preparatory work. Ukrainian participants studied European
                best practices, generously shared by colleagues from European universities. The funding received made it possible to
                purchase specialized technical equipment necessary for implementing modern approaches to mental health care. In June
                2025, the Academic Council of TNPU approved the Regulations on the Center for Psychological Resilience and Wellbeing,
                which were developed in cooperation with Ukrainian and European project partners.

                </div>
                <p>
                    The Center employs specialists from the Departments of Psychology, Developmental Psychology and Counseling, as well
                    as practicing psychologists who provide a wide range of psychological services, including individual and group
                    counseling, support for individuals who have experienced traumatic events, and supervisory and peer supervision for
                    psychological service professionals.
                    <br><br>Educational activities are also a priority and include conducting educational and socio-psychological
                    training sessions, seminars, master classes, and surveys, as well as implementing programs aimed at developing
                    resilience and emotional wellbeing.

                        <p>An important area of the Center’s work is methodological and research activity, which includes developing
                            educational and methodological materials, adapting European models of psychological support to the Ukrainian
                            context, and building international partnerships for the exchange of experience.

                            The Center will not only provide psychological services, but will also serve as a practical base for
                            training future psychologists.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Students majoring in psychology have the opportunity to undergo practical training, gaining real experience
                            working with clients, participating in training sessions, supervisions, and developing psychological

                        <p>
                            The Center aims to strengthen psychological resilience, promote the development of emotional self-regulation
