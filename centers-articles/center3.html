                The University's Centre for Psychological Resilience and Wellbeing is currently operating in Bogdan Khmelnitsky
                Melitopol State Pedagogical University. Its creation was the result of BK MSPU's participation in the international
                project “Boosting University Psychological Resilience and Well-being in (post-)war Ukrainian nation” (BURN), which
                is being implemented with the support of the EU's Erasmus+ programme. The main task of the Centre is to provide
                accessible psychological support and develop resilience skills among students, teachers and staff who are facing the
                consequences of war.
                <br><br>Project objective and strategic context
                <br><br>As part of the BURN project, partner universities are creating a network of centres designed to strengthen
                the capacity of academic communities to address mental health issues. The project aims not only to develop
                infrastructure, but also to develop new approaches to psychological well-being.
                <br><br>Special attention is given to training specialists who work with traumatic experiences and developing
                cooperation with local communities and volunteer initiatives. This approach allows us not only to respond to
                requests, but also to systematically build support for people who have survived the consequences of war.
                <br><br>Material and technical supplies
                <br><br>In 2024–2025, the Centre significantly expanded its capabilities thanks to the equipment received as part of
                the project. In particular, it has purchased a Lenovo Thinkbook 16 G6 IRL laptop, an INTBOARD GT65 65" interactive
                panel, an IRIScan Desk 6 A4 desktop scanner, a VR kit with a relaxation pouf, touch-sensitive blankets, a fibre
                optic light rain, a touch-sensitive sandbox with backlighting, and a humidifier.
                <br><br>These resources are actively used both during individual work and in group formats, allowing for
                diversification of techniques and increased effectiveness of interaction with participants.
                <br><br>Psychological support groups
                <br><br>Throughout 2025, the Centre ran psychological support groups aimed at dealing with emotional exhaustion,
                anxiety, adaptation difficulties and resource recovery. Students, lecturers and university staff, as well as
                internally displaced persons, took part.
                <br><br>Group meetings took place in various formats, ranging from short thematic sessions to longer cycles. The
                work is carried out by psychologists from the Centre and the Department of Psychology, using evidence-based practice
                methods. The groups are open and meet every week according to a fixed schedule.

            <p>Intervision activity
                <br><br>For psychology students who are starting to provide counselling or already do so on a regular basis,
                intervision meetings are organised to discuss complex cases, practise techniques and receive support from
                professional colleagues. Intervision has become a kind of resource space for specialists who work in stressful
                conditions and need professional support.
                <br><br>The moderator of the intervision group is Ella Eminova, a psychologist at the Resilience Centre. The invited
                guests are professional practitioners who share their own practical experience.
                <br><br>Presentation of results at conferences
            
                <br><br>The Centre's team took part in one of the sections of the III International Scientific and Practical Conference

                <br><br> At the First International Scientific and Practical Conference ‘Psychology, Physical Culture, Sports and
                Comprehensive Rehabilitation: A Multidisciplinary Approach in the Context of Social Transformations’ (13–14 November
                2025, Zaporizhzhia), a report was presented on the topic: ‘The Use of Innovative Psychological Approaches,
                Interactive Practices, Modern Equipment and Intervision Groups in the Activities of the Centre for Psychological
                Rehabilitation and Rehabilitation of Children and Adolescents with Disabilities.’ Zaporizhia), a report was
                presented on the topic: ‘The use of innovative psychological approaches, interactive practices, modern equipment and
                intervision groups in the activities of the Centre for Psychological Resilience and Well-being of the Melitopol
                State Pedagogical University within the framework of the Erasmus+ KA2 BURN project.’ The speakers were: Olesia
                Yesina, trainee lecturer; Ella Eminova, psychologist-consultant at the Centre.

                university community, expanded its range of services, and established stable formats for interaction with students
                and teachers.
                <br><br>Thus, the use of new tools and approaches gained through participation in the BURN project has made it
                possible to improve the quality of work and strengthen its practical impact on the daily life of the university.
