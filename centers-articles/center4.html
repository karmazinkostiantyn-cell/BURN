                    The Center for Psychological Resilience and Wellbeing at Kherson State University was established within the
                    BURN project to strengthen mental-health support for students and university staff. While sharing the common
                    mission of enhancing psychological wellbeing across Ukrainian universities, our Center focuses on creating
                    accessible, student-oriented spaces for learning, reflection, and personal growth. We combine evidence-based
                    psychological approaches with a community-building perspective, ensuring that support is both professional and
                    responsive to the needs of our academic community.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A distinctive feature of our Center is a strong emphasis on training formats. We conduct short thematic
                    workshops (1–3 hours), full-day trainings, and practice-oriented learning modules that develop emotional
                    intelligence, communication skills, stress management, and self-regulation. We also coordinate a Student
                    Psychological Club – a peer-learning and practice space where students explore wellbeing topics, engage in
                    reflective exercises, and build supportive networks. Additionally, our team facilitates intensive in-person
                    learning
                    weeks, offering deeper immersion into topics such as resilience, self-care, and trauma-informed communication.

                <p>The Center operates in Ivano-Frankivsk, where the university is temporarily located due to the ongoing
                    situation in southern Ukraine. We collaborate closely with academic departments, youth initiatives, and
                    international partners to ensure that our activities remain relevant, practical, and inclusive. Our goal is to
                    empower students, early-career specialists, and staff with tools for wellbeing and resilience, and to contribute
                    to
                    the broader system of psychological support being developed across Ukrainian higher education.
