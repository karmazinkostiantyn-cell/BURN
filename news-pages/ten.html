                <p>A  sensitivity training for university staff working with war-affected students will take place soon. The event will bring together lecturers, psychologists, academic advisors, and administrative personnel from Ukrainian higher education institutions.
<br>The 16-hour program aims to strengthen trauma-informed competencies. The training will cover the impact of psychological trauma on learning, behavior, and social interactions, and provide practical tools for creating a safe and supportive educational environment. Key topics include trauma-informed education, empathetic and non-violent communication, Psychological First Aid (PFA) principles, and strategies to support staff mental health and prevent burnout.
<br>The program will be delivered in a blended format, including interactive lecture, case studies,  group discussions, and micro-practices in self-regulation. Participants will learn to recognize signs of stress, respond ethically to crisis situations, and adapt teaching practices to avoid retraumatization.
<br>The event is expected to enhance institutional capacity for humane, resilient, and inclusive higher education, highlighting the role of universities as safe spaces of trust and recovery for students affected by war.
