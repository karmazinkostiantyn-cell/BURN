                    <span>Steering Committee Meeting — Brief
                        <br>December 18, 2024</span>
                    <br>The BURN consortium held its final 2024 Steering Committee meeting to review progress across all Work Packages
                    and prepare for the next phase of implementation.
                    <br><span>Management and Reporting</span>
                    <br>Partners discussed revised timesheet and financial reporting templates, ongoing dissemination requirements, and
                    equipment procurement for university psychological centers. A major shipment is expected by December 24, with
                    remaining items to follow in early 2025.
                    <br><span>Curriculum Development</span>
                    <br>After the September study visit to Latvia, teams continued developing BA, MA, and PhD-level syllabi with EU
                    mentor support. The BA syllabus and teaching materials have been finalized; MA and PhD teams are progressing toward
                    external expertise and university approvals.
                    <br><span>Psychological Centers and Staff Training</span>
                    <br>All roundtable recordings are now available, and Ukrainian partners will prepare memos to inform statute
                    development. A training course on motivational interviewing will run in April–May 2025. A study visit for practical
                    psychologists to Estonia will take place on March 10–14, focusing on trauma work and art therapy.
                    <br><span>Capacity Building and Winter School</span>
                    <br>The study visit to Berlin was successfully completed. The online Winter School will be held on January 13–23,
                    2025, covering EMDR, psychodynamic crisis intervention, and staff care. All materials will be archived on IPU
                    Moodle.
                    <br><span>Dissemination and Communication</span>
                    <br>The consortium continues strengthening website visibility and social media outreach. A new Facebook page has
                    been created following a cyberattack. MSPU and KSPU will co-host a conference in 2025 for BURN partners to present
                    project results.
                    <br><span>Quality Assurance</span>
                    <br>Evaluation results from study visits to Latvia and Germany showed high relevance and strong impact on course
                    development and trauma-informed practices. Full reports are available on OneDrive.
                    <br><br>BURN consortium moves into 2025 with strong coordination, shared progress, and continued commitment to
                    enhancing psychological resilience and wellbeing in Ukrainian higher education.
