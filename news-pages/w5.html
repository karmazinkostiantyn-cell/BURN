               <p>Psychological Support Center (PSC) of the Department of Psychology – How We Operate and Achieve Our Goals at the University of Latvia Presented by Dr. Laura Pirsko, Head of PSC and Director of the Professional Master Program in Psychology. Laura Pirsko explained the structure of the psychological center, which is part of the Faculty of Psychology at the University of Latvia.</p>

               This center has been operating within the Faculty of Psychology for several years and is responsible for providing psychological services at the master's level. During their studies, master's students work as employees of this center, undergoing internships as consultants and receiving supervision. It is particularly important to emphasize that the main goals of the psychological center are to provide a foundation for the implementation of psychological research for the master's program, as well as to offer psychological assistance and counseling, including CBT (cognitive-behavioral therapy), to clients. They have a waiting list of clients who can receive help at the faculty and can also undergo diagnostic assessment there.</p>

                    The psychological center serves as a bridge between the community, specifically the city of Riga, and the university, as it facilitates cooperation with stakeholders in providing not only educational but also psychotherapeutic and psychodiagnostic services. The main goals include offering internships at this center, serving as a research base, and obtaining project grants. The center also co-organizes educational events and promotes psychology within the community alongside the faculty.

                <p>Clients can access therapy provided by master's students under the supervision of professors. Each year, between 2 to 10 professors oversee this supervision. Information about available services is disseminated through websites and social media, allowing people to fill out an application form, which creates a waiting list. Currently, there are 189 people on the waiting list for counseling and diagnostics, and 262 individuals are currently undergoing therapy. Each student typically supervises about two clients per year during their third and fourth semesters in the master's program, meeting with them for at least two sessions per week, sometimes two to four sessions. Additionally, students receive weekly supervision from a faculty professor to discuss complex cases. What are the typical requests at the center? Specifically, 65% of the clients are adults, and up to 35% are children. This proportion is similar to that found in private practice. Among these adults, 25% are students. The main issues they seek help for include emotional difficulties such as depression or anxiety, as well as adaptation problems and learning difficulties. In terms of gender distribution, 68% of the clients are women, and 32% are men. Diagnostic assessments account for 30% of the center's services, 65% are individual consultations, and 5% are group sessions.</p>

                <p>A typical consultant at the center is a second-year master's student specializing in clinical psychology or health psychology. As mentioned, they manage two to four clients or client sessions per week. Students regularly participate in intensive group supervision with a professor, or individual supervision when necessary for complex cases. Together with the professor, they analyze these cases, forming a robust practical training program based on cognitive-behavioral therapy and schema therapy. This program helps them develop essential skills such as counseling techniques, case management, and diagnostic skills, effectively bridging the gap between theory and practice.</p>
