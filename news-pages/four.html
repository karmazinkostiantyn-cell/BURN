                    <br> The BURN consortium held its scheduled Project Steering Committee meeting on June 4, 2025, bringing together
                    representatives of TNPU, KSPU, MSPU, KSU, DSPU HIFL, UT, IPU, and UL. Partners reviewed progress across all Work
                    Packages and aligned upcoming reporting and implementation steps.
                    <br><span>WP1 – Management and Reporting</span>
                    <br>The consortium confirmed timelines for the upcoming progress report. All teams will update their technical
                    contributions in OneDrive and submit Interim Financial Statements by June 20. TNPU will prepare the consolidated
                    report over July–August. The next management meeting is set for September 5, 2025.
                    <br><span>WP2 – Academic Programme Development</span>
                    <br>External evaluation of the BA, MA, and PhD syllabi is underway, with reviews expected by the end of June.
                    Following external expertise, each Ukrainian university will finalize internal approvals. Updated syllabi, reviews,
                    and teaching materials will be uploaded to OneDrive.
                    <br><span>WP3 – Establishing Psychological Resilience Centers</span>
                    <br>A unified statute for the Centers has been drafted and legally reviewed. It will be translated into English for
                    UT’s feedback. Each institution will adapt and approve its statute in June or August ahead of Center launches in
                    September 2025.
                    <br><span>WP4 – Training Programmes and Center Launch</span>
                    <br>UA partners confirmed readiness to open Centers in September 2025. Work on training programmes (Deliverable due
                    December 2025) will begin at the start of the academic year, with a possibility of timeline adjustment depending on
                    implementation progress.
                    <br><span>WP5 – Dissemination and Visibility</span>
                    <br>KSPU presented updated dissemination planning for the first 18 months. Website improvements are ongoing,

                    <br><span>WP6 – Monitoring, Quality Assurance, and Feedback</span>
                    <br>Recent activities have received strong positive evaluations. The Winter School scored 100% positive on
                    organization and over 92% on content relevance and structure. The Estonia study visit also received 100% positive
                    relevance ratings. Additional responses are still required for the roundtable questionnaire.
                    <br><br>The BURN consortium continues progressing toward strengthening psychological resilience, well-being
