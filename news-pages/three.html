                    <br>WP1 – Project Management
                </span>
                
                    <br>The Committee expressed appreciation for the successful Winter School and Estonian study visit. Partners
                    reviewed the upcoming interim technical report (open July 1) and agreed to finalize inputs before the June
                    management meeting. Updated financial and timesheet templates were shared, with expenditures due by June 1.
                
            
                <span><br>WP2 – Course Development</span>
                
                    <br>EU and UA teams continue to advance BA, MA, and PhD-level course materials. Internal evaluation is underway
                    (deadline: April 30). External reviewers will include one expert from the EU and one from Ukraine, ensuring
                    relevance to wartime educational needs. External expertise is due July 31, with course approvals and launch
                    planned by September 30.
                
            
                <span><br>WP3 – Statute Development & Capacity Building</span>
                
                    <br>Following the successful Estonia visit, work continues on developing statutes for Centers of Psychological
                    Resilience and Wellbeing. UA universities nominated psychologists to draft statutes by end of May, with approval
                    expected by July. A possible June meeting will support review and alignment.
                
            
                <span><br>WP4 – Center Launch & Training Programmes</span>
                
                    <br>The online Winter School (January 13–23, 2025) concluded successfully. Centers are scheduled to launch in
                    September 2025. Work has begun on developing training programmes for university staff and local communities,
                    with potential for a joint working meeting in Ternopil to accelerate progress.
                
            
                <span><br>WP5 – Dissemination</span>
                
                    <br>Partners emphasized strengthening the BURN website with additional materials, improved navigation, and unified
                    design. All project results will be openly accessible. Dissemination opportunities include the Organizations and
                    Institutions in Times of War conference (submission deadline: June 30).
                
            
                <span><br>WP6 – Quality Assurance</span>

                    trauma-informed educational practices across Ukrainian universities.
