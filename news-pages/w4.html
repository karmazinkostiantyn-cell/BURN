                <ul>
                    <li>    Group A: Participants considered the perspective of students and discussed criteria for a successful degree program. They also explored how students could recognize when these criteria are met.</li>
                    <li>    Group B: Participants took the perspective of lecturers, identifying criteria for a successful degree program from their point of view. They also speculated on how students would recognize the fulfillment of these criteria.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Each group engaged in short breakout sessions for 10 minutes, followed by a 5-minute discussion in the plenum.</p>

                <p>After the breakout sessions, participants shared and discussed their opinions on evaluating the quality of studies and teaching. The exchange likely provided valuable insights and perspectives from both students and lecturers, contributing to ongoing efforts to enhance the educational experience.</p>
