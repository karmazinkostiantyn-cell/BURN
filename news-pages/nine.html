                <p>We are pleased to invite you to participate in the upcoming Local Summer School on Psychological Resilience and Wellbeing, organized under the framework of the Erasmus+ Capacity Building project “Boosting University Psychological Resilience and Wellbeing in (Post-)War Ukraine” (BURN, Grant Agreement No. 101129379). This initiative brings together academic staff, practitioners, and students from Ukrainian partner universities and international collaborators to strengthen institutional capacity in trauma-informed mental health support and crisis psychology.
<br>The Summer School will offer a comprehensive programme of interactive workshops, skill-building sessions, and applied training designed to enhance psychological resilience, promote emotional wellbeing, and foster peer-to-peer learning. Participants will engage with evidence-based methodologies, share best practices, and develop competencies essential for supporting individuals and communities affected by the ongoing challenges of war and post-war recovery. 
<br>This event represents a unique opportunity to exchange experience with European partners, deepen understanding of contemporary psychological care frameworks, and contribute to the establishment of sustainable support systems within Ukrainian higher education institutions. We look forward to your active involvement and to collectively advancing practices that strengthen wellbeing across our universities and communities.
<br>Further logistical details and registration information will follow shortly.
