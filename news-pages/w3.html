               Speakers: Dr. Phil Langer and Dr. Lars Kuchinke from the International Psychoanalytic University Berlin GmbH.

<br>Dr. Kuchinke's presentation sheds light on Germany's psychologist education system, highlighting its emphasis on openness, granting course authors full autonomy over content. Lecturers are esteemed as experts, entrusted by universities competing globally, where they integrate international psychological education trends. In German psychological education, achieving a delicate balance between theory and practice is paramount. This focus stems from laws governing psychologist training and national requirements prioritizing practical skill application, especially for future psychotherapists. Despite this, a potential shortage of psychologist-researchers looms on the horizon.</p>
