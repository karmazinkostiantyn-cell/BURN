               <p>During the international conference "Alarmed Science – Knowledge-Production in a State of Emergency," held on January 20–22, 2025 at VUIAS / CEU IAS in Budapest, the research design was presented on the transformation of academia based on case studies of displaced Ukrainian universities.

<br>The study was developed within the framework of the Erasmus+ KA2 Capacity Building in Higher Education project "BURN – Boosting University Psychological Resilience and Wellbeing in (Post-)War Ukrainian Nation" (Project No. 101129379 – BURN – ERASMUS-EDU-2023-CBHE), funded by the European Union.

<br>The full-scale Russian invasion has radically transformed the landscape of knowledge production and cultural diplomacy in Ukraine. Ukrainian academia faces numerous challenges, including shifts in research priorities, increasing reliance on international funding, and the large-scale displacement of scholars and students. These pressures threaten the academic infrastructure and may have long-term consequences. At the same time, increased international mobility has fostered new connections and intellectual opportunities. The Ukrainian case illustrates broader global trends of academic precarity and underscores the urgent need to reconsider institutional partnerships, emergency funding mechanisms, and epistemic justice.

<br>The conference brought together Ukrainian and international scholars to explore how knowledge-producing institutions have adapted to wartime emergencies. Participants shared innovative academic models and discussed practical strategies for supporting higher education during and after the crisis.</p>
