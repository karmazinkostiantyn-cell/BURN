               The webinar emphasized the importance of establishing comprehensive Center for Psychological Resilience and Wellbeing within universities. These centers offer a variety of support services to help students, faculty, and staff thrive.

<br>Understanding differencies between Projet's Center for Psychological Resilience and Wellbeing and Resilience Centers that provided by Ministry of Social Policy was presented by Lars Kulchinke and supported by K. Bondar (Kryvyi Rih Pedagogical University (KSPU)

<br>Key Takeaway: University Centers differ from those proposed by the Ministry of Social Policy. University centeres offer a different range of services, including research, educational programs, consultations, and practical assistance. Additionally, they focus on individual and institutional resilience development, and have greater autonomy due to a combination of funding sources.

<br>Building Effective University Resilience Centers had a Collaborative Discussion that moderated by Dr. Lars Kulchinke

<br>Olha Lovnys from Ternopil National University focus on this discussion delved into the structure and methods of operation for university resilience centers. Key questions addressed included:</p>
<ol>
    <li>    What services should these centers provide?</li>
    <li>    How can they collaborate with state-run centers and other organizations?</li>
    <li>    How will they be funded?</li>
    <li>    What human resources and infrastructure are needed?</li>
</ol>
<p>The webinar highlighted the distinction between resilience (the ability to adapt and cope with challenges) and mental health (overall emotional and psychological well-being). Project's centers will play a crucial role in promoting mental health and well-being across the university community. They achieve this by offering various support services and conducting research to build stronger, more resilient communities.

<br>The webinar also featured discussions with representatives from various universities, highlighting their specific needs and interests:
