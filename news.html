                    <span>BURN Winter School and Staff Care Workshop Brief</span>
                    <br>On <span>January 15-23, 2025</span>, the BURN Winter School dedicated its second day to an in-depth exploration
                    of <span>EMDR-assisted therapy protocols for chronic pain.</span> Under the guidance of <span>Mark Grant</span>,
                    participants examined extended and abbreviated EMDR protocols, their integration with complementary therapeutic
                    methods, and the structure of bilateral stimulation in the psychotherapeutic process. Through case studies and
                    practical demonstrations, Mark emphasized the role of desensitization, close attention to clients’ subjective
                    experiences, and the nuances practitioners must consider when applying EMDR techniques. Drawing on more than 20
                    years of experience, he outlined effective approaches and highlighted common challenges for newcomers.
                    <br>In parallel, the Winter School hosted the <span>Staff Care Workshop: Addressing the Care Needs of Staff</span>,
                    a 10-hour training supplemented by 6 hours of supervision, led by <span>Carmen Scher</span> and <span>Dr. Phil
                        Langer.</span> The workshop focused on self-care, emotional sustainability, and reflective practice for
                    professionals supporting trauma survivors. Participants strengthened their skills in managing secondary traumatic
                    stress, maintaining healthy boundaries, and developing individualized self-care strategies through structured
                    supervision.
                    <br>Together, these activities reinforce BURN’s mission to enhance psychological resilience and professional
                    wellbeing across Ukrainian universities in wartime and post-war conditions.
