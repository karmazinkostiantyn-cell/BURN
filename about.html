                <p>BURN project serves as an umbrella for collaboration between 3 EU HEIs from Estonia, Germany and Latvia and 5
                    UA
                    universities (three of them were severely affected by the war and had to relocate to safer regions with the
                    teaching staff and students scattered all over Ukraine and Europe).<br>
                    <br>
        
        
                    BURN activities include online experience sharing webinars, study visits to Latvia, Estonia, Germany,

                    autumn/spring summer schools for psychologists (BURN), training sessions for the university community

                    Ukrainian project participants will have a unique possibility to generate and transfer both European
                    experience
                    (refers to SV BURN) and ideas on improving educational and psychological services, offering psychological
                    support, strengthening international cooperation (refers to online seminars, winter school and training
                    course
                    BURN) in the process of post-war restoration.
                    The Centers for Psychological Resilience and Wellbeing (BURN) will innovate the UA universities and empower
                    them
                    with tools and knowledge for psychological rehabilitation, increase their ties with the local government
                    bodies
                    and communities.
                    The new courses and university centers will also help the psychology students develop communication, ethics,
                    problem solving, organization, and research skills, commitment to learning, and emotional stability.
